/* Use print(message) for output.
   Default tag for message is <pre>. Use print(message,'div') to change containing element tag.

   Message can contain HTML markup. You may also tweak index.html and/or styles.css.
   However, please, REFRAIN from improving visuals at least until your code is reviewed
   so code reviewers might focus on a single file that is index.js.

/* Print examples:
   print('ABC');
   print('<strong>ABC</strong>');
   print('<strong>ABC</strong>', 'div');

   print('human; John; male; 2; 2; Hello world!; Rex, Tom, Jenny');
   print('human; <strong>John</strong>; male; 2; 2; <em>Hello world!</em>; Rex, Tom, Jenny');
